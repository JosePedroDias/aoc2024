# Algorithms

I tried my best to come up with the algorithms on the fly, but
it makes sense to capture meaningful ones. 


## BFS / DFS

## DP

## A* (?)

to find the shortest path using an heuristic

## Dijkstra (?)

to find the shortest path between nodes is a weighted graph

## Shoelace formula

## Bron-Kerbosch Algorithm (23)

finds the most well connected sets of nodes in a (non-directed) graph
